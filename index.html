            <p id="tribute-caption">Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm, Sweden
                on September 8, 1989. By
                the age of 8, he was already mixing in his bedroom. Inspired by
                his
                brother, who was also a DJ, Tim began making music at the age of
                16.
                In May 2007, he signed on a record label where he refined his
                craft.
                It was not until 2010 when Begling released the hit song "Seek
                Bromance," which reached the top 20 in several countries,
                including
                Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and Sweden.</p>
