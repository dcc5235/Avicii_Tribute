            <p id="tribute-caption">Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm, Sweden on September 8, 1989. By
            the age of 8, he was already mixing in his bedroom. Inspired by his
            brother, who was also a DJ, Tim began making music at the age of 16.
            In May 2007, he signed on a record label where he refined his craft.
            It was not until 2010 when Begling released the hit song "Seek
            Bromance," which reached the top 20 in several countries, including
            Belgium, France, United Kingdom, and Sweden.</p>
